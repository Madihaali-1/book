# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics book. This comprehensive guide covers advanced robotics concepts, simulation frameworks, and AI integration techniques for developing humanoid robots.

This book is organized into four main modules:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI, communication models, and robot structure with URDF
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics simulation, digital twins, and sensor validation
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Photorealistic simulation, VSLAM, and navigation
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Voice commands, cognitive planning, and capstone projects

Each module builds upon the previous ones, providing a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robotics development.
